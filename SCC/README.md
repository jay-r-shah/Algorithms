## Strongly Connected Components 

Solution to Week 1 programming assignment of the Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
course.

Compute the sizes of the five largest Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) of the given directed
graph.

**Arguments:**

1. Path to text file representing the directed graph
1. 0/1 flag indicating if test cases should be executed
1. if 1 - path to test cases folder. If this is empty, the current working directory is assumed.
         
**Test cases format**:

input_{filename}.txt and output_{filename}.txt
where output_{filename}.txt is a text file containing the sizes of the five larges SCCs of the graph described in
input_{filename}.txt

**Example:**

SCC ..\..\test_SCC.txt 1 C:\Path\To\Test\Cases
